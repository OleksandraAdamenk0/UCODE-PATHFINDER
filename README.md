# UCODE-PATHFINDER
The Pathfinder program is designed to find the shortest paths between all combinations of islands using information from a file that describes the bridges connecting them. The goal is to automate the calculation of optimal paths in scenarios where efficient time and resource use is necessary, such as navigation, logistics, and network routing.
